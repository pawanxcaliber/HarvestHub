Automated Irrigation system

The project aims to develop a smart garden irrigation system using a Raspberry Pi 4, various 
sensors, and a water pump. This system is designed to automatically monitor the soil moisture 
level, temperature, and humidity, and then water the plants when needed. The system is 
intended to simplify the process of plant care, making it more efficient and convenient.
With this project, users will be able to remotely monitor and control their garden irrigation 
system using a web-based interface. They can set custom watering schedules, adjust watering 
durations, and receive notifications when the system detects any issues or abnormalities. This 
project combines hardware and software to create a user-friendly and intelligent irrigation 
system that can enhance the gardening experience for both hobbyists and professionals.
